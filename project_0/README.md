### What case are we solving?
We need to write a program which gueesees right the number set by computer within a minimum number of attempts.

**Competition terms:**
- Computer sets the integer number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it right. By "guessing it right" it is meant that we need to write a program which gesses the number correctly.
- An algorythm takes into account information wheter the guessed number is bigger or smaller than set number.
