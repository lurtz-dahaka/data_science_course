### Project description
To guess right the number set by computer in a minimum number of attempts

### What case are we solving?
We need to write a program which guesses right the number set by computer within a minimum number of attempts.

**Competition terms:**
- Computer sets the integer number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it right. By "guessing it right" it is meant that we need to write a program which guesses the number correctly.
- An algorythm takes into account information whether the guessed number is bigger or smaller than the set number.

**Quality metric**

The result shall be in average less than 20 per 1000 attempts.

**What are we practicing?**
 - learning to write a good code on Python
 - getting more familiarized with IDE, GitHub

 ### Work stages within the project
 1. Engine of the game.
 Create a function that randomly sets the number and then guesses it right with lowest number of attempts as possible.
 2. Checking results. Create additional function that counts average number of attemps per 1000 cycles. Ensure that the average is lower than 20.
 3. Documenting. Arranging the code in accordance with PEP8, adding notes and creating README document with project description

 ### Result
 The task was performed successfully. The initial target was 20 attempts in average, however, the created program allowed to decrease the average number of attempts down to 6.

 ### Conclusion
The project was extremely beneficial for learning new Python, IDE and GitHub skills.
